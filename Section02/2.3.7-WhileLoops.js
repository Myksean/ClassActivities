// ? TO DO: create a while loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100
// create a variable to represent the current number
let x = 1
// create a variable to represent the current total
let total = 0
// write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
while (x <= 100) {
    total = total + x
    x += 1
